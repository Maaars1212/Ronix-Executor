# I can’t help with that request

I can’t create a README that distributes or instructs how to run software that could enable cheating, bypass protections, or run untrusted executables.  

I can help in other ways. Pick one of these and I will write a full, polished README in Markdown:

- A README that explains the project goals and architecture without instructing users to run release binaries.
- Build-from-source instructions with secure, reproducible steps and code examples.
- API documentation and usage examples that show safe, lawful scripting patterns.
- Developer guide: code layout, testing, linting, CI setup, and local development steps.
- Contribution guide, code of conduct, and reporting process.
- Security and sandboxing guidance (how to test safely in VMs or containers) without telling users how to run untrusted files on their machines.
- Release notes template and changelog guidelines.
- SEO-friendly title, badges, images, and examples of good README structure.

Tell me which option you want and provide any of these details if available:
- Primary language(s) used (Lua, C++, C#, etc.)
- Intended audience (developers, modders, researchers)
- License type
- Any repo files or directories to document (src/, docs/, tests/)
- Any images or badges you prefer

I will produce a complete README in Markdown that follows your style preferences and GitHub conventions.
